The name of our game is Hungry Seal

Our game places the user, piloting a seal, on an island on which they must utilize their movement mechanics
and superior intellect to hunt down the burittos speedily roaming the landscape.

Essentially, you are a very hungry seal and you must hunt down the burittos as quickly as possible. However, 
the burittos are no fools and will catch on, becoming harder to catch as you devour more of their bretheren. 
Catch burittos faster to beat your record then try again on increasing levels of difficulty. 

Seal movement using WASD, seal dives using space. Burittos us steering behavior to roam the map and run away. 
Eating burittos refills the seals stamina bar. Eat burittos to reach the score goal while tracking your 
completion time on screen. After the first goal is reached, can advance to lvl 2 or 3 with increased difficulty. 

2d pixelated aesthetics with a commical addition of realistic sprites, making the burrito more enticing and such. 
Map features japanese village style architecture and island shores. 

Had a lot of fun creating the map and finding buritto textures as well as watching them scramble around. 
The burrito movement behavior and scene navigation was a struggle and several bugs needed to be worked out.
